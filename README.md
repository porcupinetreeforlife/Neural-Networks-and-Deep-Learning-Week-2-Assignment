# Neural-Networks-and-Deep-Learning-Week-2-Assignment

This project is a part of the course named "Neural Networks and Deep Learning (Course 1 of the Deep Learning Specialisation)" by Andrew Ng on Coursera. It involves building a binary logistic regression classifier that can classify images into one of two categories, "cat" or "non-cat."

The major learning outcomes from this project include:-
1. Classification by logistic regression
2. Defining the logistic regression cost function
3. Implementing the model using vectorisation
